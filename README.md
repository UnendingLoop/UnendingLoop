# Hi, I'm Fanil

I'm learning and practicing backend development with Go.  
I like clean code, simple solutions, and projects where it's clear *what is happening and why*.

Right now I'm focused on hands-on practice: 
- building pet projects, 
- exploring service architecture, 
- reading and fixing other people’s code, 
- learning how to work properly with concurrency and databases.

## What I'm working on now

- Go: REST APIs, goroutines, channels, generics  
- PostgreSQL and plain SQL  
- Service architecture: `handler → service → repository`  
- Docker, migrations, Swagger  
- Unit testing and error handling  
- Kafka (producer / consumer, event processing)

I'm currently studying at **WildBerries Tech School** on the **“Goroutine Golang”** backend course.

## What I care about in backend development

- backend without hidden magic  
- predictable service behavior  
- clear and boring (in a good way) architecture  
- code that can be read and maintained later  
- understanding *why* something works, not just *that* it works

## Pet projects

Most of my repositories are about learning and experimenting:

- **Go + Kafka + PostgreSQL**  
  Event-driven microservice with producer/consumer and in-memory cache  
  https://github.com/UnendingLoop/Level0

- **EM-test**  
  Subscription tracking: filtering, period-based calculations, date logic  
  https://github.com/UnendingLoop/EM-test

- **go-playground**  
  Bloom Filter, Morse Decoder, generics, data structures  
  https://github.com/UnendingLoop/go-playground

- **WB Tech**  
  Educational and practice tasks  
  https://github.com/UnendingLoop/WB-Tech

## A bit of background

Before moving into backend development, I worked as a product and project manager  
(e-commerce and media platforms, including international teams).

That experience helps me think about backend systems in a more practical way:
- how services are actually used in production
- why logging, errors and stability matter
- how code lives *after* deployment, not only locally

---

## Where I'm heading

I want to grow into a strong Go backend developer  
and work on production systems where reliability and code quality really matter.
